title: "Allow myself to introduce... myself"
---

My name is Kenneth Moreland, and I have a blog.  Why have I created this
site?  Because apparently I have too much time on my hands.

Lately I have been amusing myself with various geeky projects that one
might call hobbies.  Every once in a while a get an urge to record what I'm
doing in an effort to show off to anyone unlucky enough to be in the
general vicinity.

I also have a [professional web site](https://www.kennethmoreland.com)
where I post the formal work I do for my job.
